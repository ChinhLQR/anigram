RuntimeError (Devise does not support scoping OmniAuth callbacks under a dynamic segment
and you have set "/(:locale)/users". You can work around by passing
`skip: :omniauth_callbacks` to the `devise_for` call and extract omniauth
options to another `devise_for` call outside the scope. Here is an example:

    devise_for :users, only: :omniauth_callbacks, controllers: {omniauth_callbacks: 'users/omniauth_callbacks'}

    scope '/(:locale)', locale: /ru|en/ do
      devise_for :users, skip: :omniauth_callbacks
